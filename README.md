# Movie Recommendation System In Python 
Made with Google Colab, the Python machine-learning movie recommendation system uses a cosine similarity algorithm. The program takes a file called movies.csv which contains a table of movies and fields to describe these movies. The movies in the file can be replaced with any movies of the program user's choice. This program takes a user-inputted movie suggestion, finds the 20 most similar movies in the given movies.csv file, and prints them to the screen.
